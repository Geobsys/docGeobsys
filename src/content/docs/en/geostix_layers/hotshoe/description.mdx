description: Description of the hotshoe/flash sync layer.
---

The Hotshoe/flash sync layer allows the GEOSTIX to record both the **exact timestamp** of the photo and its **precise position** as well as the **orientation of the camera-GEOSTIX system** in space.

This layer is designed to be mounted on the hotshoe of any camera equipped with a standard flash socket.

## How it works

Each photo taken by the camera sends a pulse — or more precisely, a brief low signal (GND).

The GEOSTIX equipped with the layer hotshoe captures this signal and records:
- the exact time with sub-microsecond accuracy,
- the position,
- the orientation provided by the GEOSTIX's IMU.

The data is saved onto the microSD card located under the GEOSTIX and accessible via USB connection.

The log file is named `EXTEVENT.LOG` and contains several fields described below:
