description: this quick guide helps you rapidly leverage the GEOSTIX-X5 capabilities
---

The GEOSTIX-X5 is based on Septentrio's [Mosaic-X5](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gnss-receivers/gnss-receiver-modules/mosaic-x5) GNSS module. It stands out from other GEOSTIX models with several additional features:

## Specific to GEOSTIX-X5

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. **Ethernet via USB:**
    when the GEOSTIX is connected to a PC via the magnetic USB cable, it provides access to the module's settings through a simple web browser at [192.168.3.1](http://192.168.3.1/).

2. **Data recording:**
    The module is equipped with its own SD card for recording RINEX data or in Septentrio's proprietary format (*.sbf).
    
    SD card access:
    The SD card is accessible when the GEOSTIX is connected to a PC via the magnetic USB cable.
    
    It appears as a disk containing the directory **SSN/GRB0051** (GRB0051 being the Mosaic-X5 code name)
    
    **Recording organization:**
    Each recording session is organized in a subdirectory named YYDDD, where:
    - YY represents the year of the first recording.
    - DDD represents the day of the year of the first recording.
    
    Within these directories, files are named according to the following convention: **gstxDDDX.YYo** or **gstxDDDX.YYp**  
    - DDD and YY correspond respectively to the day and year of the first recording.
    - X corresponds to the session number within the day:
    - 0 for a recording covering a full day.
    - From 1 to 9, then from A to O for hourly sessions (from the 1st to the 24th hour).
    
    **gstxDDDX.YYo** corresponds to observations
    **gstxDDDX.YYp** corresponds to ephemerides

## Configure automatic RINEX saving

<Aside type="tip" title="GEOSTIX-X5 - RINEX recording">
  By default, the GEOSTIX-X5 saves RINEX data daily with a 1Hz frequency.
</Aside>

It is entirely possible to change different parameters concerning RINEX recording.
This is done from the web interface, using a browser (address 192.168.3.1)

<Steps>
1. **Click on the "Admin" tab then select "Expert Control"**
