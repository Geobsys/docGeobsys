title: Overview of Sensor Layers
description: Introduction to the concept of sensor layers.

Thanks to its modular design, the GEOSTIX offers unique extensibility for this high-end GNSS receiver.

Any device connected to its base constitutes a sensor layer. These layers can also be communication extensions, such as 4G/LTE, RF, or WIFI modules.

GEOSTIX and its various sensor layers share a unique, robust, and waterproof electromechanical connection designed to interconnect the different components. Adding 4G/LTE communication, long-range LoRa radio links, or geotechnical sensors is as simple as stacking Lego bricks.

  Each electronic layer contains memory that stores a unique identification number, allowing the GEOSTIX to recognize the connected layers.

## 36-Pin Connector

The electronic connection includes 36 pins â€” enough to support all major standard communication protocols: USB (host or device), I2C, UART, SPI, CAN, as well as high-speed parallel transfer protocols, timepulse output, and precise event timestamping.

<Aside type="danger" title="Never do this!">
  Never twist a layer or the GEOSTIX relative to another layer, as this may damage the circuit boards. Despite the keying system, excessive torque can break parts.

  Always unscrew or screw only the stainless steel ring while applying gentle pressure on the top of the GEOSTIX to help the gasket fit properly.
