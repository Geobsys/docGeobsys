description: NMEA messages available on the GEOSTIX receiver and their description.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The GEOSTIX receiver outputs standard NMEA 0183 messages over Bluetooth. These messages carry positioning, satellite, and timing information used by survey and GIS applications.

## Available NMEA messages

| Message | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **GGA** | Position, fix quality, number of satellites, and HDOP |
| **GLL** | Latitude, longitude, and UTC time |
| **GNS** | Multi-constellation fix data with per-constellation mode indicators |
| **GSA** | Active satellites and dilution of precision (PDOP, HDOP, VDOP) |
| **GST** | Position error standard deviations (latitude, longitude, height) |
| **GSV** | Satellites in view with elevation, azimuth, and signal strength |
| **RMC** | Position, speed, course, and date |
| **ZDA** | Full UTC date/time and local time zone offset |

Each message can be configured individually to output at a specific rate: **Off**, **5 Hz**, **1 Hz**, **0.5 Hz**, or **0.1 Hz**. See the [NMEA output configuration](/en/app/nmea_output/) guide for instructions on how to change these settings.

<Aside type="caution" title="Minimum requirements for surveying">
To use the GEOSTIX APP for surveying operations, the following NMEA output configuration is required:

- **GGA** and **GST** must be set to the **same frequency** (e.g., both at 5 Hz)
- **RMC** must be set to **1 Hz or more**
- **GSA** and **GSV** must be set to **1 Hz or less**
