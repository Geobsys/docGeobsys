When using a GNSS receiver, the position is computed at the **Antenna Phase Center (APC)**, not at the ground point. The APC is the electrical point inside the antenna dome where the GNSS signal is effectively measured.

The **Antenna Reference Point (ARP)** is the physical reference point on the receiver — on the GEOSTIX, this is the base of the 5/8" thread mount. The vertical distance between the ARP and the APC is a fixed offset specific to each receiver model.

If the GEOSTIX is mounted on a surveying pole, you must enter the total distance from the ground to the APC so the app can compute the correct ground-level elevation.

## ARP to APC offset

On the GEOSTIX, the APC is located **0.17 m (170 mm)** above the ARP. This offset must be included when entering the antenna height.

For example, if your surveying pole is **2.00 m** tall (from ground to the base socket), the total antenna height to enter in the app is:

> 2.00 m + 0.17 m = **2.17 m**

<Aside type="caution">
If you are not using a pole and the GEOSTIX is placed directly on the ground, you should still set the antenna height to **0.17 m** to account for the phase center offset.

## Setting the antenna height in the app

On the main page (map view), tap the antenna height button at the bottom right of the screen.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="/images/app/antenna_height_button.png" alt="Antenna height button on the GEOSTIX APP map view" width="300" />
</div>

A dialog opens where you can enter the total height **h** from the ground to the antenna phase center (pole height + 0.17 m) in meters, then tap **Save**.

</div>

<Aside type="note">
The default value is **0.17 m**, which corresponds to the GEOSTIX placed directly on the ground with no pole.
