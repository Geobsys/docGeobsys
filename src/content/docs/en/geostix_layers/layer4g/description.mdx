The 4G/LTE module enables data transmission using the cellular network.

This module is compatible with **all cellular networks worldwide** thanks to its integrated multiband modem and antenna within the enclosure. The nano SIM card reader is accessible from beneath the module. LED indicators on the front panel allow quick observation of the moduleâ€™s status.

This 4G/LTE module provides several key benefits, including:

- **Bidirectional communication with the GEOSTIX device** via the **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. This feature allows robust, real-time data exchange. Sending MQTT commands enables remote control and configuration of the GEOSTIX, while receiving MQTT messages allows for the collection of telemetry data, status updates, and alerts generated by the device. This interaction facilitates the integration of GEOSTIX into broader IoT (Internet of Things) systems.

- **Enhanced flexibility of the GEOSTIX** through its software-based transformation into either an **NTRIP base station** or an autonomous mobile receiver (rover). This adaptability provides significant versatility in GNSS deployments. As a base station, GEOSTIX can serve as a reference point for RTK differential measurements. In autonomous rover mode, it can perform surveys and collect positioning data independently. Switching roles is achieved through simple software reconfiguration, eliminating the need for additional dedicated hardware.
