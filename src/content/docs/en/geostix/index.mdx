The GeoStix is a high-end GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver developed by [GEOBSYS](https://geobsys.com), a French company originating from the instrumentation research lab of the [IGN](https://ign.fr) (French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information).  
Designed to combine lightness, robustness, modularity, and precision, it is especially well-suited for professionals who require high-precision geolocation in the field.

## Key Features
**Ultra-precise**: delivers accuracy down to a few millimeters thanks to RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) technologies.

**Modular**: allows the addition of complementary modules such as 4G, long-range local radio, solar panels, or custom sensors.

**Compact and lightweight**: 14 cm high, 4 cm in diameter, weighing just 225 gâ€”easy to transport and install in various environments.

**Extended battery life**: up to 20 hours of autonomy depending on the model, thanks to optimized energy consumption.

## Available Models
**GeoStix-M8**: single-frequency, ideal for applications requiring 2.5 cm + 1 PPM horizontal and 5 cm + 1 PPM vertical accuracy.

**GeoStix-F9**: dual-frequency, offering improved accuracy of 1 cm + 1 PPM horizontal and 2 cm + 1 PPM vertical.

**GeoStix-X5**: triple-frequency, the most advanced model, with 0.6 cm + 0.5 PPM horizontal and 1 cm + 1 PPM vertical accuracy, and very high reliability even under strong solar activity.
